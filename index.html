<article><span>Welcome!</span><br>You may not know me now, but by the time you finish reading this page, I hope that you will have a greater understanding of me! If you don't, please make sure to <a href="mailto: miketalley@hotmail.com">send me your questions</a>!<br><br>
I was born right here in Boston, MA which is where I lived before moving to Tucson, AZ when I was 14. Living in the desert was an amazing experience, however, I always felt that I would eventually end up back in Boston. While living in Tucson, I formed the foundation of my programming knowledge in my high school library. I had met some friends there that were using notepad to craft basic HTML sites and uploading them to <a href="http://www.tripod.lycos.com/">Tripod</a> and later Geocities. They helped me learn basic HTML and showed me some websites with basic tags to use. This sparked my interest in programming and led me to enrolling in the first C++ class offered at my school.<br><br>
After high school I briefly attended the University of Arizona where I took a class in Java, but left soon after and started working for Microsoft. Fortunately for me, although it didn't seem so at the time, my job was outsources to India in late 2003 and I decided to come back to Boston and finish my college degree. I attended <a href="https://www.middlesex.mass.edu/">Middlesex Community College</a> and then moved on to <a href="http://http://www.bentley.edu/">Bentley University</a> and graduated with my Finance degree with a minor in Computer Information Systems. The classes that I took there included Java and MS Access which helped me to get a better understanding of how databases work.<br><br>
During the time I attended school, I was working full time for Bank of America during the day and taking classes at night. Upon graduation I transferred to <a href="http://www.merrilllynch.com">Merrill Lynch</a>, the investment side of the company. At the time, it seemed like the right thing to do for me and the way to further my career in banking utilizing my new finance degree.<br><br>
It has been almost 4 years now since making that change and only now have I realized that banking and finance are not really the best use of my skills. After some serious thought and self-reflection I realized that computers, technology, and gadgets have always been a continual interest for me and a part of my life. So, I decided to take steps to enhance my computer skills and began reading books about various computer-related topics including <a href="http://www.java.com/en/">Java</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a>, <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a>, <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, and eventually <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. My research on Ruby and Rails definitely resonated with me the most. I had finally found something that I wanted to learn to proficiency and far beyond!<br><br>
Unfortunately, teaching myself would take far too long. Like the late Steve Jobs said during his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc">2005 commencement speech for Stanford</a>, "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."<br><br>
These are words I am trying hard to live by and looking to accomplish with the help of <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>.<br><br><br>
<span>Mike's Hobbies</span>
</article>
<div class="hobbies">
<div id="guitar" class="hobbybox">
  <p><span class="name">Guitar</span><br>
  <small>Playing guitar is one of the most amazing things to me. It can put me totally at ease after a stressful day and help me to connect with friends and family. I have been playing since I was 15 and I currently have two guitars at home. A Fender Stratocaster HSS Electric(pictures here) and a Martin Acoustic. I play all kinds of music, but really enjoy 90's alternative and classic rock such as The Foo Fighters, 311, Led Zeppelin, and Stone Temple Pilots.</small></p>
</div>
<br>
<div id="hockey" class="hobbybox">
  <p><span class="name">Hockey</span><br>
  <small>I've been playing hockey since I was 6 years old and I still have all of my teeth! I usually play once a week in a local league called <a href="http://www.stinkysocks.net">Stinky Socks</a>. I'm also a die-hard Boston Bruins fan as you may have guessed.</small></p>
</div>
<br>
<div id="snowboarding" class="hobbybox">
  <p><span class="name">Snowboarding</span><br>
  <small>Snowy out? No problem! Living in New England, I've learned to enjoy winter sports and snowboarding is a great way to spend the snowy days of winter. This sport is really rewarding, although difficult to learn at first. I love taking trips to <a href="http://www.wachusett.com/">Wachussett Ski Area</a> and occasionally I will make a trek up to New Hampshire, Maine, or Vermont to get some real powder. </small></p>
</div>
<br>
<div id="hiking" class="hobbybox">
  <p><span class="name">Hiking</span><br>
  <small>When its not freezing out(or sometimes even when it is), I love to get away from the city and surround myself with trees and mountains. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Monadnock">Mount Monadnock</a> in New Hampshire is my usual spot for hiking. When I am really looking for a challenge <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Lafayette">Mount Lafayette</a> is a tougher climb but the harder the climb the more satisfying it is when you complete it!</small></p>
</div>
<br>
<div id="videogames" class="hobbybox">
  <p><span class="name">Video Games</span><br>
  <small>Since I got the Nintendo Entertainment System at age 6, I've been an avid gamer. Although I still have the NES hooked up at home, I have been playing mostly Xbox One games most recently <a href="http://www.titanfall.com/">Titanfall</a>. Some of my all time favorites are Quake, Too Human, Counter-Strike, Asheron's Call, and Borderlands(1 & 2).</small></p>
